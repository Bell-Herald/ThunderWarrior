You can view your equipped melee weapon from the home page and click on it to equip a diferent one or manage it's modifications. While in a game, press \'f\' to swap your ranged weapon out for your melee one. Just like with ranged weapons, melee weapons have all sorts of diferent values that effect how they perform.");

This deals more damage than ranged weapons, but it has less range and a lower rate of fire. You also are unable to block while stabbing.");

Doing this reflects all projectiles that are shot at you from within an angle specific to each melee weapon. You also can block and stagger enemeies who attack you with a ranged weapon.");
