Set the game quality between six and a thousand percent for custom graphics. By lowering the percent, your graphics will be worse, but the game might run smoother. By inceasing the number, your graphics will be higher, but if you increase it too high, there is a chance of the game crashing. If this happens, lower your graphics settings. The Home Menu graphics can also be altered seperately from the Game Menu. Changing this value too high is much less dangerous than the Game Quality, but you might want to think for a moment before turning it all the way up to 1000%. The Fps changes the maximum frames per second that your game is updated. This is only setting the maximum value as by default we fun the game as fast as possible. If you set the fps too high, your system might not be able to run that fast, causing it to still run at your system's maximum fps, likely 60. Decreasing this value may decrease lag and incrasing it is rarely dangerous.");
