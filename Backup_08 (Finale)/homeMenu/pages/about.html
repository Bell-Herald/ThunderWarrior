When a player first starts out their journey as a thunder warrior, they have a sellection of classes to choose from, including Jedi,
sabateur, sith, infiltrator, and more. The class chosen designates which Skills that a Thunder Warrior starts ouy the game with. These
Skills are Power, Constitution, Thaumaturgy, Stamina, Speed, and Utility. Power represents the damage your Thunder Warrior will be able
to impart on others through weapons and abilities. Constitution represents the health, healing speed, and other health related traits of
your character. Thaumaturgy is the inate ability of your Thunder Warrior to control the flow of the universe in order to use incredible
abilities and supernatural powers. Stmina is what powers many of your Thunder Warrior's more natural abilities, allowing them to strike
with melee weapons, sprint at a fast speed, or block attacks. Speed not only represents how fast a Thunder Warrior can move, but also how
quickly they can switch from diferent actions, like walking to shooting, or switching weapons. Utility represents the abilities the 
ThunderWarrior is able to use that don't necesarilly rely entirely on stamina or thaumaturgy, as they are the other useful actions that the
class is able to take. The skills that power abilities are Thaumaturgy, Stamina, and Utility. The skills that more passively buff the Thunder
Warrior are Speed, Power, Constitution, and also Stamina. Another important aspect of the chosen clas is that it dictates whether your Thunder
Warrior will fight on the side of the Empire, to keep order, or to defect and fight on the side of the rebellion to fight for freedom. An
aditional important aspect of which class is chosen is the additional passive traits that each has access to. Each class can use a number of
traits that give them certian buffs unavailable to the other classes, such as gaining health or stamina after a kill or performing unique
attacks when striking with a weapon. The final aspect of the class is it's starting equipment. Each class starts with a full set of armour, one
melee weapon, and one ranged weapon.

        <p class = 'descriptionTitle'>Equipment</p>
        <br>
        <p class = 'descriptionText'><span class = paragraphStart></span>
Equipment is a crucial aspect of Thunder Warrior: Genesis. Equipment is unlocked in two ways, either by killing an enemy and having a chance of
earning a piece of equipment from them, or by using credits and metal earned by playing to unlock new equipment in the shop. Equipment includes
armour: Helmets, Torso pieces, Leg pieces, Right Arm pieces, and Left Arm pieces as well as weapons: Ranged Weapons and Melee Weapons. When equipment
is purchased from the shop, it will have a random rarity, with the rarity of the equipment increasing it's statistics. When equipment is taken from an
enemy, it will either be of the same rarity as it was when the enemy had it, or it's rarity will be decreased by one from it's extensive use.
When equipment is taken from an enemy, the enemt does not lose any equipment, but both players keep a version of it. Either way that the equipment is
unlocked, it will be at the level of the Thunder Warrior who unlocked it. The higher the level of the Thunder Warrior, the more powerful their gear is.
The seven rarities for equipment are Junk, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Insane.

        <p class = 'descriptionTitle'>Modifications</p>
        <br>
        <p class = 'descriptionText'><span class = paragraphStart></span>
Modifications are needed to make equipment as powerful as possible. Modifications are gained in a similiar way to equipment, by either unlocking them
in the shop for credits or taking them from a defeated enemy. Modifications also have the same rarities as equipment: Junk, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic,
Legendary, and Insane. Every piece of equipment can equip a number of modifications, with the higher the rarity of the equipment meaning the higher
the ratity of the modification that can be equipped. Each modification has one Main Enhancement, This Main Enhancement increases one of the equipment's
stats, such as Defense for armour, or Damage for a weapon. The modification also gives up to four Minor Enhancements. Each of these minor enhancements will
either change one stat of the equipment to a much smaller degree, or create one Universal Change for the entire Thunder Warrior. The Universal Changes include
equipment changes like damage for all weapons, but can also include ability cost or an aspect of one of the Thunder Warrior's traits like the time it takes to
start healing which is an aspect of Constitution. These minor Enhancements are described as changing, not increaseing, a statistic, because while each minor
enhancement will most like give an increase their is also a chance a modification will have one with a slight Decrease. Even though it may seem best to just
deconstruct these and buy a new mod, having a Decrease often meens that the other traits of the mod will be even more powerful. To equip a modification, Click
on the weapon's icon on the game's home screen. Then, once you have been taken to the weapon page, click on the weapon's image or the empty modification slots
beneath it to be taken to your list of available mods. Then, click on one to equip it. To unequip a mod, click on the modification slot where it is shown to
be equipped and it will be unequipped.

        <p class = 'descriptionTitle'>Resources</p>
    <br>
        <p class = 'descriptionText'><span class = paragraphStart></span>
There are three key resources in Thunder Warrior: Genesis: Credits, Metal, and Experience. All three resources are earned after completing a game. If a
THunder Warrior wins, they recieve more resources, and they recive more the better tha they do during the game by getting kills, damageing enemies, and
playing the objective. Upon getting a kill, as well as having the chance to take a piece of equipment or modifications as described in the Equipment and Modifications sections, there is also
a chance to take credits or metal from the enemy. As with the taken equipment and modifications, these enemy does not lose credits or metal, but a new version of part of
their credits or metal goes to the salyer. Credits and Metal are needed together to unlock new equipment from the shop. Credits are also used to unlock new
modifications. As the Thunder Warrior gains enough Experience, it levels up. Upon levelling up, you choose to either increase the Thunder Warrior' Maximum
Health, Maximum Stamina, or Maximum Thaumaturgy. After leveling up, new equipment and modifications gained have a level equal to the Thunder Warrior's new level.

After starting a game of Thunder Warrior: Genesis, your Thunder Warrior will be taken to a planet where there is the greates threat from the enemy.
More planets are always being added to the game. Each planet has it's own unique obstacles and a unique strategy will need to be used to conquer on
each of them. Because fighting across an entire planet would be unreasonable, we have created a single location on each planet for Thunder Warriors
to clash. They include the Emperial Outpost in Conar Sun, which is on Julix IV; an uncovered resources depositit in the Anakoran Desert on Athemorum,
The overun City of Make'Tui on Frin'Sai; and the Secret Rebel Depot hidden in Fernackie's Valley on Tralion Catornay. The way to read the planet's name,
description, and location is Planet Name: Planet Description, which is followd by a Location on the planet.

There are a number of Game Modes in Thunder Warrior: Genesis and here we will describe each of them. In Team Deathmatch, the Empire and Rebellion face of
to defeat one another. Everony has three lives and after dieing for the third time, you are out. The team with the most surviving members wins. In one versus
one deathmatch, two Thunder Warriors clash. Whoever defeats the other three times wins. In Zone Capture, one side will attempt to capture a zone by standing
in it for a certian amount of time. While the other side is trying to stop them from capturing it. In Double Zone Capture, both sides are trying to capture a
zone, being either the same zone or both capturing difrent zones. In Infiltration, one side is trying to steal an item from the other. To do this, they must
make their way to an item located in the oponet's bas and bring it back to their own. But, while carryin the item, they are made an easy target and the whole
team needs to work together to defend them. In Double Infilatration, both teams are trying to steal an item from the other's base and bring it back to their
own. In Sabotage, both teams are competing to bring one item to the other's base.
