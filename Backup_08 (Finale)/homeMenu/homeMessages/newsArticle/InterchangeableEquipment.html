newSection('Hw it Works', "After starting the game, each thunder warrior has one full set of equipment. For instance, A thunder Warrior who takes the path of a Sentinel would have armour and equipment from the Sentinel set. As the Thunder Warrior continues on their journey, they will unlock new equipment. From the game's home menu, you can click on an icon of a piece of equipment to view it. After doing this, you can click on one of the displayed pieces of equipment of the same type. For instance, only helmets are displayed if you are switching out another helmet. This can lead to incredibly creative and cistomizable character builds, which Thunder Warrior: Genesis is all about!");
newSection('What is Equipment?', "Equipment is a crucial aspect of Thunder Warrior: Genesis. Equipment is unlocked in two ways, either by killing an enemy and having a chance of earning a piece of equipment from them, or by using credits and metal earned by playing to unlock new equipment in the shop. Equipment includes armour: Helmets, Torso pieces, Leg pieces, Right Arm pieces, and Left Arm pieces as well as weapons: Ranged Weapons and Melee Weapons. When equipment is purchased from the shop, it will have a random rarity, with the rarity of the equipment increasing it's statistics. When equipment is taken from an enemy, it will either be of the same rarity as it was when the enemy had it, or it's rarity will be decreased by one from it's extensive use. When equipment is taken from an enemy, the enemt does not lose any equipment, but both players keep a version of it. Either way that the equipment is unlocked, it will be at the level of the Thunder Warrior who unlocked it. The higher the level of the Thunder Warrior, the more powerful their gear is. The seven rarities for equipment are Junk, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Insane.");
