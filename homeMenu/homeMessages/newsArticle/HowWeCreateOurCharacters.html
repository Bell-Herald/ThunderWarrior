We try to make sure that our new characters are ones that most players will enjoy.");
            newSection('Design', "After creating an idea, we go to the drawing board and figure out exactly how to create this character in three dimensions and what it's movemements will look like. We then find or create refrence images to use of the character as we model it. This step is important because if there is a mistake in the design, the entire charcater might fall apart.");
            newSection('Modelling', "Then, we begin to model the character. Using a 3D modelling softwere, we build the entire character, one vertice (or edge of a polygon) at a time until the entire character is there. We then move onto adding textures and colors to bring out the look of the character. Finally, we create animations that the character will use for certian actions to truly bring the character to life.");
            newSection('Customizability', "In order to maintain the high level of customization we present in Thunder Warrior: Genesis, we do not add the characters to the game in single whole pieces. Rather, we split the character into multiple parts: head, torso, right arm, left arm, legs, ranged weapon, melee weapon, and other parts. We do this so that the seperate parts do not need to go together on the same character. Rather, they can be seperately applied to a Thunderwarrior along with equipment from a diferent character. This preserves the customization of our game will still allowing players to use one single character if they wish by collecting all of it's piecess.");
            newSection('Implementation', "The last step is to actually put the character into the game. To do this, we take thousands of images of them from diferent angles and at diferent stages of their animation. We then load these to a player who is using the character. Then, when the player begins a game, the parts of diferent characters they selected are combined to create an original 3D character of the player's choice using their own chosen equipment. This is what you see in the game and how it gets there.");
