newSection('Location Overview', "After starting a game of Thunder Warrior: Genesis, your Thunder Warrior will be taken to a planet where there is the greates threat from the enemy. More planets are always being added to the game. Each planet has it's own unique obstacles and a unique strategy will need to be used to conquer on each of them. Because fighting across an entire planet would be unreasonable, we have created a single location on each planet for Thunder Warriors to clash. They include the Emperial Outpost in Conar Sun, which is on Julix IV; an uncovered resources depositit in the Anakoran Desert on Athemorum, The overun City of Make'Tui on Frin'Sai; and the Secret Rebel Depot hidden in Fernackie's Valley on Tralion Catornay. The way to read the planet's name, description, and location is Planet Name: Planet Description, which is followd by a Location on the planet.");
newSection('New Locations', "Since we are constantly adding new planets to the game, we are also open two new suggestions. Is there any planet in mind you would like your Thunder Warrior to travel to? Or do you have photographs you want to have transformed into a planet? For any planet related topics or any other ThunderWarrior: Genesis related topics, head over to the feedback tab and give us your opinion.");
