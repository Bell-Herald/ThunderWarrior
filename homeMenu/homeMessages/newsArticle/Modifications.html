            newSection('Modifications Detailed', "Modifications are needed to make equipment as powerful as possible. Modifications are gained in a similiar way to equipment, by either unlocking them in the shop for credits or taking them from a defeated enemy. Modifications also have the same rarities as equipment: Junk, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Insane. Every piece of equipment can equip a number of modifications, with the higher the rarity of the equipment meaning the higher the ratity of the modification that can be equipped. Each modification has one Main Enhancement, This Main Enhancement increases one of the equipment's stats, such as Defense for armour, or Damage for a weapon. The modification also gives up to four Minor Enhancements. Each of these minor enhancements will either change one stat of the equipment to a much smaller degree, or create one Universal Change for the entire Thunder Warrior. The Universal Changes include equipment changes like damage for all weapons, but can also include ability cost or an aspect of one of the Thunder Warrior's traits like the time it takes to start healing which is an aspect of Constitution. These minor Enhancements are described as changing, not increaseing, a statistic, because while each minor enhancement will most like give an increase their is also a chance a modification will have one with a slight Decrease. Even though it may seem best to just deconstruct these and buy a new mod, having a Decrease often meens that the other traits of the mod will be even more powerful. To equip a modification, Click on the weapon's icon on the game's home screen. Then, once you have been taken to the weapon page, click on the weapon's image or the empty modification slots beneath it to be taken to your list of available mods. Then, click on one to equip it. To unequip a mod, click on the modification slot where it is shown to be equipped and it will be unequipped.");
