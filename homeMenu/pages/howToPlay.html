The first step to playing is to create an account. You can create an account by clicking on the sign up button
on the bar at the top of the screen. After doing so, you will be taken to a form where you create a username,
email, and a password. It is important to make sure you use a secure password and your actual email adress. Next,
you will have to confirm your email. You should be sent a confirmation code imediately or within the next few
minutes. Enter this code into the confirmation tab. We recommend copying and pasting. After this, you will have
a fully functioning account!

There are many aspects to the webpage, so ut may at first seem intimidating to some. On the far right of the bar
is a three line icon that turns to an x and shows a drop down menu when you hover over it. This is the main menu.
Within the main menu, you have access to the Home Screen, About Page, News, Updates, Contact Information, Credits,
and the How to Play Page. An easy way to return to the home menu is by clicking on the Thunder Warrior: Genesis
title or icon on the left of the top bar. Once you have signed in, the 'sign in / sign up' options will disapear
from the top bar. They will be replaced by your username or email and a profile icon. By hovering over this name
or icon, you can access ways to customize your own account such as Preferences, Information, Deletion, Confirmation,
Invalidation, and Signing Out as well as a way to send us feedback or leave a review. See more about account customization

Thunder Warriors are controlled using very simple keys to make the game easy for anyone to pick up. Use the arrow keys
or WASD to move. If you are using a ranged weapon, aim with your mouse and click or press the space bar to fire in that direction.
But be warnred, the more you shoot,
the more heat your weapon gainsuntil it eventually overheats. Take a break after a time to let it cool more efficiently.
By pressing F, you can switch between your melee and ranged weapon. Melee weapons also fire in the diretion you aim, but cost
Stamina. Hold shift to block with a melee weapon. Learn all about Melee weapons here. Come here if you want to learn how to pick
the best equipment for each match.
