# Thunder Warrior: Genesis

I love game design and computer science. In highschool, I decided to combine these two passions into a personal project. I spent countless hours teaching myself videogame design and engineering, before creating Thunder Warrior: Genesis. In this game, the player controls a 3D character armed with a ranged weapon, a melee weapon, and numerous special abilities. Players can unlock new equipment and abilities for their character, with the equipment they are wearing changing both their stats and apearence. Players can then send their character into an online multiplayer arena where they face off in a team deathmatch. I designed and implemented an original game engine, multiplayer server, database, 3d models, and animations. I self-published and marketed the game.

This is a trailer I made back when I was advertising the game. As the main focus during the project was the game itself, note that the time spent on the trailer is small enough to not represent the quality and time spent on the game.
